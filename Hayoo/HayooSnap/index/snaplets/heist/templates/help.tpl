      <h2>Basic Usage</h2>
      <p>By default, Hayoo! searches for function names,
	module names, signatures and function descriptions.
	With every letter typed, Hayoo! will show the results
	it thinks are best matching the query as well as some
	suggestions on how the words from the query could be completed.
	Clicking one of these suggestions will replace the
	according word in the query.
      </p>
      <p>Hayoo! displays results as a list of functions,
	including full qualified module name and the function signature.
	Clicking the function name will lead directly to the corresponding
	documentation while clicking the module name will lead to the
	documentation of the module. Additionally, Hayoo! shows
	the function description (if available) and provides a link
	leading directly to the source of the function (if available).
	The description of the function can be expanded by
	clicking on the small '+' sign.
      </p>
      <p>Along with the results, Hayoo! shows two lists on
	the right, containing the top fifteen root-modules
	and packages. These are aggregated from the actual results.
	Clicking on each of these will further restrict the current
	query to the respective module hierarchy or package. On the left side,
	package search results are shown if the query matches
	the package information.
      </p>
      <h2>Advanced Queries</h2>
      <p>If words are seperated by whitespace, Hayoo!
	will search for results containing both words.
	Instead of using whitespace, the explicit
	<span class="query">AND</span>
	operator can be used. Hayoo! also supports
	<span class="query">OR</span> and
	<span class="query">NOT</span>
	operators, although the
	<span class="query">NOT</span>
	operator may only be used together with
	<span class="query">AND</span>, e.g.
	<span class="query">map NOT fold</span> or
	<span class="query">map AND NOT fold</span>.
	Operator precedence can be influenced using round parentheses.
	Phrases can be searched using double quotes, e.g.
	<span class="query">"this is a phrase"</span>.
      </p>
      <p>It is possible to restrict a search to certain packages or modules.
	The most simple way would be to just include the package name
	in the search, e.g.
	<span class="query">map base</span>
	will prefer hits from the base package. But the restriction can
	also be more explicit, like
	<span class="query">map package:base</span> or like
	<span class="query">map module:data.list</span>.
	It is also possible to specify several different modules or packages,
	like this:
	<span class="query">fold module:(data.list OR data.map)</span>.
	This will return all hits for fold in the module hierarchies below Data.List and Data.Map.
      </p>
      <p>Hayoo! always performs fuzzy queries.
	This means, it tries to find something even if the query contains
	spelling errors. For example, Hayoo! will still find "fold"
	if "fodl" is being searched. If Hayoo! detects "&gt;" in the query string,
	it will only search for signatures. A signature query may
	consist of explicit type names as well as type variables.
	For example, searching for "a &gt; b" will find signatures like "Int &gt; Bool".
      </p>
      <h2>Scope</h2>
      <p>Currently, Hayoo! searches all packages available on
	<a href="http://hackage.haskell.org">Hackage</a>.
	Additionally, any Haskell documentation generated by Haddock
	can be included in Hayoo!. Just send a message including an URI
	where the documentation can be found to
	<a href="mailto:hayoo@holumbus.org">hayoo@holumbus.org</a>.
