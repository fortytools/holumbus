Compression Benchmark for Occurences serialized as ByteStrings


run of make whole-index with tracing compression with bzip2

     1,772,928 occurence sets compressed
 3,040,856,400 total # of bytes before compression
   493,212,983 total # of bytes after compression
           6.2 compression factor
          16.2 % remaining # bytes
     3.609.544 maximum size of serialized occurence set
       417.261 compressed size of maximum size occurence set

       895,475 occurence set with negaive compression
    31,473,880 total # of bytes before compression
    44,286,808 total # of bytes after compression
           0.7 compression factor
         140.7 percent "remaining" # bytes
          35.1 bytes is the arithmetic mean of occurence sets with negative compression
            72 maximum size with negative compression
            74 maximum compressed size with 72 bytes input
          50.5 % of occurence sets have negative compression

results

* about 1/2 of the occurence sets generate overhead when compressing them
* this is bad concerning runtime AND space
* this is bad for small indexes

consequences

* when trying to compress, put a single byte
  in front of the bytestring indicating compression/no compression
* all bytestrings with less than 80 bytes are not compressed,
  all others are compressed
* the # of bytes for the lower limit for compression
  may be raised moderatly for perfomance gains
* when decompressing, check 1. byte, take the tail and
  decompress or take it as it is
